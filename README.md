This is a web application made for the [International Rice Research Institute](http://irri.org/) for the internship project, <br><strong>Drone Image Analysis.</strong>

Official IRRI repository for this project is found [here](https://github.com/InternationalRiceResearchInstitute/Drone-Image-Server).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Dependencies

The application requires the following installed for development:

* `NodeJS` framework (version 8.6.0 above)
* `PostgreSQL` database (version 9.3.23 above)
* `yarn` (optional) CLI (version 1.2.1 above)

In the PostgreSQL database, you must create a `SUPERUSER` to access the database, and a `PUBLIC` (access privilege to all) schema called `dronedb` with the `PASSWORD` of `dronedb`.

Clone the application [server](https://github.com/jasarqui/Drone-Image-Server) and [client](https://github.com/jasarqui/Drone-Image-Client) folders. Run a terminal inside both folders and then run `npm install` or `yarn add` in each. This will set up the remaining dependencies needed by the application to run.

In the server terminal, run `npm run seed` or `yarn seed` to set up the schema, then run `psql dronedb < node_modules/connect-pg-simple/table.sql` to create the session table.

## Development

When developing the app, open terminals that will open both the [server](https://github.com/jasarqui/Drone-Image-Server) and the [client](https://github.com/jasarqui/Drone-Image-Client) folders. Run `npm start` or `yarn start` on both terminals. Once the application loads, you can start developing.

It is also important to note that everytime you make a change to the code of the application, `create-react-app` already has a module that updates itself through `react-scripts` so you get all the new updates automatically.

## File Structure

## About the Developers

This web application is made by [Jasper Arquilita](https://github.com/jasarqui), a student from University of the Philippines Los Ba√±os. The other part of the project which is for <strong>Image Processing</strong> is made by a co-student, [Loria Malingan](https://github.com/malinganloria).
